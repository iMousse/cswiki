### 常见问题

解决让Docker配置的容器nginx用主机的IP

Jenkins无法使用 ssh命令和 nginx无法使用 localhost都是因为这是属于Docker的容器，对环境进行了隔离。

```sh
# 查看镜像版本
docker image inspect seataio/seata-server:1.5.1|grep -i version
# 加载镜像
docker load -i 

tar -zcvf jenkins.tar.gz jenkins
tar -zxvf jenkins.tar.gz
```



## 环境准备

### **安装Centos7**

此方案适用于新款苹果MacBook的M系列芯片电脑，需要在电脑中安装VMware Fusion，建议版本为13.x以上。

- 安装地址：[VMware Fusion安装地址](https://download3.vmware.com/software/FUS-1350/VMware-Fusion-13.5.0-22583790_universal.dmg)

![image-20240403172339266](./assets/image-20240403172339266.png)

网盘文件是分卷压缩的文件，先用cat命令合并文件

```sh
cat CentOS-7-aarch64-08191738.iso.zip* > CentOS-7-aarch64-08191738.iso.zip
```

在解压文件

```sh
unzip CentOS-7-aarch64-08191738.iso.zip
```

<br/>

#### 配置网络

在VMware中配置网络信息，新增网络，允许虚拟机使用 NAT，并设置 DHCP

![image-20240228011031971](assets/image-20240228011031971.png)

通过命令行修改 Mac 网络配置

```sh
sudo vi /Library/Preferences/VMware\ Fusion/networking
```

![image-20240228011216376](assets/image-20240228011216376.png)主要修改两个点：

- 对应的网络名称为 VNET_2
- IP地址为：`192.168.150.101`，固定IP地址为：`192.168.150.102`

<br/>

修改完成后，退出VMware Fusion，然后重新打开VMware Fusion软件。

<br/>

以上操作完成后，检查网关是否正确，如果显示`192.168.150.2`表示设置成功，查看命令（修改成自己的网络名称）：

```Shell
sudo vi /Library/Preferences/VMware\ Fusion/vmnet2/nat.conf
```

#### 设置yum源

安装wget

```sh
yum install wget -y
```

备份yum配置文件

```sh
mv /etc/yum.repos.d/CentOS-Base.repo \
	 /etc/yum.repos.d/CentOS-Base.repo_bak
```

下载阿里云yum配置文件

```sh
wget http://mirrors.aliyun.com/repo/Centos-altarch-7.repo -O \
		 /etc/yum.repos.d/CentOS-Base.repo
```

更新yum缓存

```sh
yum makecache
```

安装一些常用工具

```sh
yum install -y gcc automake autoconf libtool make vim net-tools
```



### 安装Docker

[安装Docker资料](../../struct/cloud/00操作篇-安装Docker.md)

首先需要大家虚拟机联网，安装yum工具

```sh
yum install -y yum-utils \
           device-mapper-persistent-data \
           lvm2 --skip-broken
```

<br/>

然后更新本地镜像源

```shell
yum-config-manager \
    --add-repo \
    https://mirrors.aliyun.com/docker-ce/linux/centos/docker-ce.repo
    
sed -i 's/download.docker.com/mirrors.aliyun.com\/docker-ce/g' /etc/yum.repos.d/docker-ce.repo
```

<br/>

创建元数据缓存，提升搜索安装 yum 速度

```sh
yum makecache fast
```

<br/>

然后输入命令：

```shell
yum install -y docker-ce
```

docker-ce 为社区免费版本。稍等片刻，docker即可安装成功。

<br/>

**启动Docker**

Docker应用需要用到各种端口，逐一去修改防火墙设置。非常麻烦，因此建议大家直接关闭防火墙！

启动docker前，一定要关闭防火墙后！！

启动docker前，一定要关闭防火墙后！！

启动docker前，一定要关闭防火墙后！！

```sh
# 关闭
systemctl stop firewalld
# 禁止开机启动防火墙
systemctl disable firewalld
# 查看防火墙状态
systemctl status firewalld
# 开机自启动
systemctl enable docker
```

<br/>

通过命令启动docker：

```sh
# 启动docker服务
sudo systemctl start docker 
# 停止docker服务
sudo systemctl stop docker 
 # 重启docker服务
sudo systemctl restart docker 
```

<br/>

然后输入命令，可以查看docker版本：

```sh
docker -v 
```

<br/>

**创建Docker网络**

```sh
docker network create hmtt
```

<br/>

**配置镜像加速**

docker官方镜像仓库网速较差，我们需要设置国内镜像服务：

参考阿里云的镜像加速文档：https://cr.console.aliyun.com/cn-hangzhou/instances/mirrors

```sh
sudo mkdir -p /etc/docker
sudo tee /etc/docker/daemon.json <<-'EOF'
{
  "registry-mirrors": ["https://hwud7scp.mirror.aliyuncs.com"]
}
EOF
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart docker
```

<br/>

**设置Docker命令重命名**

```sh
[root@centos ~]# vim .bashrc 
# .bashrc

# User specific aliases and functions

alias rm='rm -i'
alias cp='cp -i'
alias mv='mv -i'
alias dps='docker ps --format "table{{.ID}}\t{{.Names}}\t{{.Status}}\t{{.Ports}}"'
alias dc='docker-compose'
alias dis='docker images'
alias dexe='docker exec -it'
alias dlog='docker logs'
# Source global definitions
if [ -f /etc/bashrc ]; then
	. /etc/bashrc
fi
[root@centos ~]# source .bashrc 
[root@centos ~]# dps
CONTAINER ID   NAMES     STATUS    PORTS
```

<br/>

**安装DockerCompose**

DockerCompose安装地址：https://github.com/docker/compose/releases

<br/>

Linux下需要通过命令下载：

```sh
# 安装
curl -L \
https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.23.1/docker-compose-`uname -s`-`uname -m` > \
/usr/local/bin/docker-compose
```

<br/>

如果下载速度较慢，或者下载失败，可以使用 `docker-compose` 文件，上传到`/usr/local/bin/`目录。

:::warning 注意： `docker-compose` 分为 `x64` 版本 和  `aarch64` 版本

:::

<br/>

修改文件权限：

```sh
# 修改权限
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
```

<br/>

Base自动补全命令

```sh
# 补全命令
curl -L \
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/docker/compose/1.29.1/contrib/completion/bash/docker-compose > \
/etc/bash_completion.d/docker-compose
```

<br/>

如果这里出现错误，需要修改自己的hosts文件：

```sh
echo "199.232.68.133 raw.githubusercontent.com" >> /etc/hosts
```

<br/>

查看是否安装成功

```sh
[root@centos bin]# docker-compose --version
Docker Compose version v2.1.1
```

<br/>

### 安装JDK

官网下载地址：[Java 11 | Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java11)

![image-20240228024614528](assets/image-20240228024614528.png)

<br/>

上传到某个目录，然后解压缩。例如：`/usr/local/src/`

```sh
[root@centos7 src]# pwd
/usr/local/src
[root@centos src]# tar -xvf jdk-11.0.22_linux-aarch64_bin.tar.gz 
[root@centos src]# rm -rf jdk-11.0.22_linux-aarch64_bin.tar.gz 
[root@centos src]# mv jdk-11.0.22/ java/
[root@centos src]# ll
总用量 0
drwxr-xr-x. 9 root root 126 2月  28 02:50 java
```

<br/>

配置环境变量

```sh
[root@centos7 src]# vim /etc/profile
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/local/src/java
export PATH=$PATH:$JAVA_HOME/bin
[root@centos src]# source /etc/profile
```

<br/>

查看环境变量

```sh
[root@centos src]# java -version
java version "11.0.22" 2024-01-16 LTS
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment 18.9 (build 11.0.22+9-LTS-219)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM 18.9 (build 11.0.22+9-LTS-219, mixed mode)
```

<br/>

### 安装Nginx

Docker命令行启动

```sh
$ docker run -d --name nginx -d nginx:1.21.6
```

复制 nginx 的 conf 和 html

```sh
$ mkdir -p /usr/local/src/nginx
$ docker cp nginx:/etc/nginx /usr/local/src/nginx/conf
$ docker cp nginx:/usr/share/nginx/html /usr/local/src/nginx/
```

删除容器

```sh
$ docker stop nginx
$ docker rm nginx
```

重新启动

```sh
$ docker run -d \
--name nginx \
--restart=always \
--network=hmtt \
-v /usr/local/src/nginx/conf/:/etc/nginx/ \
-v /usr/local/src/nginx/html/:/usr/share/nginx/html \
-p 80:80 \
nginx:1.21.6
```

配置信息 

```nginx

# Redis configuration file example.
#
# Note that in order to read the configuration file, Redis must be
# started with the file path as first argument:
#
# ./redis-server /path/to/redis.conf

# Note on units: when memory size is needed, it is possible to specify
# it in the usual form of 1k 5GB 4M and so forth:
#
# 1k => 1000 bytes
# 1kb => 1024 bytes
# 1m => 1000000 bytes
# 1mb => 1024*1024 bytes
# 1g => 1000000000 bytes
# 1gb => 1024*1024*1024 bytes
#
# units are case insensitive so 1GB 1Gb 1gB are all the same.

################################## INCLUDES ###################################

# Include one or more other config files here.  This is useful if you
# have a standard template that goes to all Redis servers but also need
# to customize a few per-server settings.  Include files can include
# other files, so use this wisely.
#
# Note that option "include" won't be rewritten by command "CONFIG REWRITE"
# from admin or Redis Sentinel. Since Redis always uses the last processed
# line as value of a configuration directive, you'd better put includes
# at the beginning of this file to avoid overwriting config change at runtime.
#
# If instead you are interested in using includes to override configuration
# options, it is better to use include as the last line.
#
# include /path/to/local.conf
# include /path/to/other.conf

################################## MODULES #####################################

# Load modules at startup. If the server is not able to load modules
# it will abort. It is possible to use multiple loadmodule directives.
#
# loadmodule /path/to/my_module.so
# loadmodule /path/to/other_module.so

################################## NETWORK #####################################

# By default, if no "bind" configuration directive is specified, Redis listens
# for connections from all available network interfaces on the host machine.
# It is possible to listen to just one or multiple selected interfaces using
# the "bind" configuration directive, followed by one or more IP addresses.
# Each address can be prefixed by "-", which means that redis will not fail to
# start if the address is not available. Being not available only refers to
# addresses that does not correspond to any network interfece. Addresses that
# are already in use will always fail, and unsupported protocols will always BE
# silently skipped.
#
# Examples:
#
# bind 192.168.1.100 10.0.0.1     # listens on two specific IPv4 addresses
# bind 127.0.0.1 ::1              # listens on loopback IPv4 and IPv6
# bind * -::*                     # like the default, all available interfaces
#
# ~~~ WARNING ~~~ If the computer running Redis is directly exposed to the
# internet, binding to all the interfaces is dangerous and will expose the
# instance to everybody on the internet. So by default we uncomment the
# following bind directive, that will force Redis to listen only on the
# IPv4 and IPv6 (if available) loopback interface addresses (this means Redis
# will only be able to accept client connections from the same host that it is
# running on).
#
# IF YOU ARE SURE YOU WANT YOUR INSTANCE TO LISTEN TO ALL THE INTERFACES
# JUST COMMENT OUT THE FOLLOWING LINE.
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
bind 0.0.0.0 -::1

# Protected mode is a layer of security protection, in order to avoid that
# Redis instances left open on the internet are accessed and exploited.
#
# When protected mode is on and if:
#
# 1) The server is not binding explicitly to a set of addresses using the
#    "bind" directive.
# 2) No password is configured.
#
# The server only accepts connections from clients connecting from the
# IPv4 and IPv6 loopback addresses 127.0.0.1 and ::1, and from Unix domain
# sockets.
#
# By default protected mode is enabled. You should disable it only if
# you are sure you want clients from other hosts to connect to Redis
# even if no authentication is configured, nor a specific set of interfaces
# are explicitly listed using the "bind" directive.
protected-mode yes

# Accept connections on the specified port, default is 6379 (IANA #815344).
# If port 0 is specified Redis will not listen on a TCP socket.
port 6379

# TCP listen() backlog.
#
# In high requests-per-second environments you need a high backlog in order
# to avoid slow clients connection issues. Note that the Linux kernel
# will silently truncate it to the value of /proc/sys/net/core/somaxconn so
# make sure to raise both the value of somaxconn and tcp_max_syn_backlog
# in order to get the desired effect.
tcp-backlog 511

# Unix socket.
#
# Specify the path for the Unix socket that will be used to listen for
# incoming connections. There is no default, so Redis will not listen
# on a unix socket when not specified.
#
# unixsocket /run/redis.sock
# unixsocketperm 700

# Close the connection after a client is idle for N seconds (0 to disable)
timeout 0

# TCP keepalive.
#
# If non-zero, use SO_KEEPALIVE to send TCP ACKs to clients in absence
# of communication. This is useful for two reasons:
#
# 1) Detect dead peers.
# 2) Force network equipment in the middle to consider the connection to be
#    alive.
#
# On Linux, the specified value (in seconds) is the period used to send ACKs.
# Note that to close the connection the double of the time is needed.
# On other kernels the period depends on the kernel configuration.
#
# A reasonable value for this option is 300 seconds, which is the new
# Redis default starting with Redis 3.2.1.
tcp-keepalive 300

################################# TLS/SSL #####################################

# By default, TLS/SSL is disabled. To enable it, the "tls-port" configuration
# directive can be used to define TLS-listening ports. To enable TLS on the
# default port, use:
#
# port 0
# tls-port 6379

# Configure a X.509 certificate and private key to use for authenticating the
# server to connected clients, masters or cluster peers.  These files should be
# PEM formatted.
#
# tls-cert-file redis.crt 
# tls-key-file redis.key
#
# If the key file is encrypted using a passphrase, it can be included here
# as well.
#
# tls-key-file-pass secret

# Normally Redis uses the same certificate for both server functions (accepting
# connections) and client functions (replicating from a master, establishing
# cluster bus connections, etc.).
#
# Sometimes certificates are issued with attributes that designate them as
# client-only or server-only certificates. In that case it may be desired to use
# different certificates for incoming (server) and outgoing (client)
# connections. To do that, use the following directives:
#
# tls-client-cert-file client.crt
# tls-client-key-file client.key
#
# If the key file is encrypted using a passphrase, it can be included here
# as well.
#
# tls-client-key-file-pass secret

# Configure a DH parameters file to enable Diffie-Hellman (DH) key exchange:
#
# tls-dh-params-file redis.dh

# Configure a CA certificate(s) bundle or directory to authenticate TLS/SSL
# clients and peers.  Redis requires an explicit configuration of at least one
# of these, and will not implicitly use the system wide configuration.
#
# tls-ca-cert-file ca.crt
# tls-ca-cert-dir /etc/ssl/certs

# By default, clients (including replica servers) on a TLS port are required
# to authenticate using valid client side certificates.
#
# If "no" is specified, client certificates are not required and not accepted.
# If "optional" is specified, client certificates are accepted and must be
# valid if provided, but are not required.
#
# tls-auth-clients no
# tls-auth-clients optional

# By default, a Redis replica does not attempt to establish a TLS connection
# with its master.
#
# Use the following directive to enable TLS on replication links.
#
# tls-replication yes

# By default, the Redis Cluster bus uses a plain TCP connection. To enable
# TLS for the bus protocol, use the following directive:
#
# tls-cluster yes

# By default, only TLSv1.2 and TLSv1.3 are enabled and it is highly recommended
# that older formally deprecated versions are kept disabled to reduce the attack surface.
# You can explicitly specify TLS versions to support.
# Allowed values are case insensitive and include "TLSv1", "TLSv1.1", "TLSv1.2",
# "TLSv1.3" (OpenSSL >= 1.1.1) or any combination.
# To enable only TLSv1.2 and TLSv1.3, use:
#
# tls-protocols "TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3"

# Configure allowed ciphers.  See the ciphers(1ssl) manpage for more information
# about the syntax of this string.
#
# Note: this configuration applies only to <= TLSv1.2.
#
# tls-ciphers DEFAULT:!MEDIUM

# Configure allowed TLSv1.3 ciphersuites.  See the ciphers(1ssl) manpage for more
# information about the syntax of this string, and specifically for TLSv1.3
# ciphersuites.
#
# tls-ciphersuites TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256

# When choosing a cipher, use the server's preference instead of the client
# preference. By default, the server follows the client's preference.
#
# tls-prefer-server-ciphers yes

# By default, TLS session caching is enabled to allow faster and less expensive
# reconnections by clients that support it. Use the following directive to disable
# caching.
#
# tls-session-caching no

# Change the default number of TLS sessions cached. A zero value sets the cache
# to unlimited size. The default size is 20480.
#
# tls-session-cache-size 5000

# Change the default timeout of cached TLS sessions. The default timeout is 300
# seconds.
#
# tls-session-cache-timeout 60

################################# GENERAL #####################################

# By default Redis does not run as a daemon. Use 'yes' if you need it.
# Note that Redis will write a pid file in /var/run/redis.pid when daemonized.
# When Redis is supervised by upstart or systemd, this parameter has no impact.
daemonize no

# If you run Redis from upstart or systemd, Redis can interact with your
# supervision tree. Options:
#   supervised no      - no supervision interaction
#   supervised upstart - signal upstart by putting Redis into SIGSTOP mode
#                        requires "expect stop" in your upstart job config
#   supervised systemd - signal systemd by writing READY=1 to $NOTIFY_SOCKET
#                        on startup, and updating Redis status on a regular
#                        basis.
#   supervised auto    - detect upstart or systemd method based on
#                        UPSTART_JOB or NOTIFY_SOCKET environment variables
# Note: these supervision methods only signal "process is ready."
#       They do not enable continuous pings back to your supervisor.
#
# The default is "no". To run under upstart/systemd, you can simply uncomment
# the line below:
#
# supervised auto

# If a pid file is specified, Redis writes it where specified at startup
# and removes it at exit.
#
# When the server runs non daemonized, no pid file is created if none is
# specified in the configuration. When the server is daemonized, the pid file
# is used even if not specified, defaulting to "/var/run/redis.pid".
#
# Creating a pid file is best effort: if Redis is not able to create it
# nothing bad happens, the server will start and run normally.
#
# Note that on modern Linux systems "/run/redis.pid" is more conforming
# and should be used instead.
pidfile /var/run/redis_6379.pid

# Specify the server verbosity level.
# This can be one of:
# debug (a lot of information, useful for development/testing)
# verbose (many rarely useful info, but not a mess like the debug level)
# notice (moderately verbose, what you want in production probably)
# warning (only very important / critical messages are logged)
loglevel notice

# Specify the log file name. Also the empty string can be used to force
# Redis to log on the standard output. Note that if you use standard
# output for logging but daemonize, logs will be sent to /dev/null
logfile "redis.log"

# To enable logging to the system logger, just set 'syslog-enabled' to yes,
# and optionally update the other syslog parameters to suit your needs.
# syslog-enabled no

# Specify the syslog identity.
# syslog-ident redis

# Specify the syslog facility. Must be USER or between LOCAL0-LOCAL7.
# syslog-facility local0

# To disable the built in crash log, which will possibly produce cleaner core
# dumps when they are needed, uncomment the following:
#
# crash-log-enabled no

# To disable the fast memory check that's run as part of the crash log, which
# will possibly let redis terminate sooner, uncomment the following:
#
# crash-memcheck-enabled no

# Set the number of databases. The default database is DB 0, you can select
# a different one on a per-connection basis using SELECT <dbid> where
# dbid is a number between 0 and 'databases'-1
databases 1

# By default Redis shows an ASCII art logo only when started to log to the
# standard output and if the standard output is a TTY and syslog logging is
# disabled. Basically this means that normally a logo is displayed only in
# interactive sessions.
#
# However it is possible to force the pre-4.0 behavior and always show a
# ASCII art logo in startup logs by setting the following option to yes.
always-show-logo no

# By default, Redis modifies the process title (as seen in 'top' and 'ps') to
# provide some runtime information. It is possible to disable this and leave
# the process name as executed by setting the following to no.
set-proc-title yes

# When changing the process title, Redis uses the following template to construct
# the modified title.
#
# Template variables are specified in curly brackets. The following variables are
# supported:
#
# {title}           Name of process as executed if parent, or type of child process.
# {listen-addr}     Bind address or '*' followed by TCP or TLS port listening on, or
#                   Unix socket if only that's available.
# {server-mode}     Special mode, i.e. "[sentinel]" or "[cluster]".
# {port}            TCP port listening on, or 0.
# {tls-port}        TLS port listening on, or 0.
# {unixsocket}      Unix domain socket listening on, or "".
# {config-file}     Name of configuration file used.

################################ SNAPSHOTTING  ################################

# Save the DB to disk.
#
# save <seconds> <changes>
#
# Redis will save the DB if both the given number of seconds and the given
# number of write operations against the DB occurred.
#
# Snapshotting can be completely disabled with a single empty string argument
# as in following example:
#
# save ""
#
# Unless specified otherwise, by default Redis will save the DB:
#   * After 3600 seconds (an hour) if at least 1 key changed
#   * After 300 seconds (5 minutes) if at least 100 keys changed
#   * After 60 seconds if at least 10000 keys changed
#
# You can set these explicitly by uncommenting the three following lines.
#
# save 3600 1
# save 300 100
# save 60 10000

# By default Redis will stop accepting writes if RDB snapshots are enabled
# (at least one save point) and the latest background save failed.
# This will make the user aware (in a hard way) that data is not persisting
# on disk properly, otherwise chances are that no one will notice and some
# disaster will happen.
#
# If the background saving process will start working again Redis will
# automatically allow writes again.
#
# However if you have setup your proper monitoring of the Redis server
# and persistence, you may want to disable this feature so that Redis will
# continue to work as usual even if there are problems with disk,
# permissions, and so forth.
stop-writes-on-bgsave-error yes

# Compress string objects using LZF when dump .rdb databases?
# By default compression is enabled as it's almost always a win.
# If you want to save some CPU in the saving child set it to 'no' but
# the dataset will likely be bigger if you have compressible values or keys.
rdbcompression yes

# Since version 5 of RDB a CRC64 checksum is placed at the end of the file.
# This makes the format more resistant to corruption but there is a performance
# hit to pay (around 10%) when saving and loading RDB files, so you can disable it
# for maximum performances.
#
# RDB files created with checksum disabled have a checksum of zero that will
# tell the loading code to skip the check.
rdbchecksum yes

# Enables or disables full sanitation checks for ziplist and listpack etc when
# loading an RDB or RESTORE payload. This reduces the chances of a assertion or
# crash later on while processing commands.
# Options:
#   no         - Never perform full sanitation
#   yes        - Always perform full sanitation
#   clients    - Perform full sanitation only for user connections.
#                Excludes: RDB files, RESTORE commands received from the master
#                connection, and client connections which have the
#                skip-sanitize-payload ACL flag.
# The default should be 'clients' but since it currently affects cluster
# resharding via MIGRATE, it is temporarily set to 'no' by default.
#
# sanitize-dump-payload no

# The filename where to dump the DB
dbfilename dump.rdb

# Remove RDB files used by replication in instances without persistence
# enabled. By default this option is disabled, however there are environments
# where for regulations or other security concerns, RDB files persisted on
# disk by masters in order to feed replicas, or stored on disk by replicas
# in order to load them for the initial synchronization, should be deleted
# ASAP. Note that this option ONLY WORKS in instances that have both AOF
# and RDB persistence disabled, otherwise is completely ignored.
#
# An alternative (and sometimes better) way to obtain the same effect is
# to use diskless replication on both master and replicas instances. However
# in the case of replicas, diskless is not always an option.
rdb-del-sync-files no

# The working directory.

################################# REPLICATION #################################

# Master-Replica replication. Use replicaof to make a Redis instance a copy of
# another Redis server. A few things to understand ASAP about Redis replication.
#
#   +------------------+      +---------------+
#   |      Master      | ---> |    Replica    |
#   | (receive writes) |      |  (exact copy) |
#   +------------------+      +---------------+
#
# 1) Redis replication is asynchronous, but you can configure a master to
#    stop accepting writes if it appears to be not connected with at least
#    a given number of replicas.
# 2) Redis replicas are able to perform a partial resynchronization with the
#    master if the replication link is lost for a relatively small amount of
#    time. You may want to configure the replication backlog size (see the next
#    sections of this file) with a sensible value depending on your needs.
# 3) Replication is automatic and does not need user intervention. After a
#    network partition replicas automatically try to reconnect to masters
#    and resynchronize with them.
#
# replicaof <masterip> <masterport>

# If the master is password protected (using the "requirepass" configuration
# directive below) it is possible to tell the replica to authenticate before
# starting the replication synchronization process, otherwise the master will
# refuse the replica request.
#
# masterauth <master-password>
#
# However this is not enough if you are using Redis ACLs (for Redis version
# 6 or greater), and the default user is not capable of running the PSYNC
# command and/or other commands needed for replication. In this case it's
# better to configure a special user to use with replication, and specify the
# masteruser configuration as such:
#
# masteruser <username>
#
# When masteruser is specified, the replica will authenticate against its
# master using the new AUTH form: AUTH <username> <password>.

# When a replica loses its connection with the master, or when the replication
# is still in progress, the replica can act in two different ways:
#
# 1) if replica-serve-stale-data is set to 'yes' (the default) the replica will
#    still reply to client requests, possibly with out of date data, or the
#    data set may just be empty if this is the first synchronization.
#
# 2) If replica-serve-stale-data is set to 'no' the replica will reply with
#    an error "SYNC with master in progress" to all commands except:
#    INFO, REPLICAOF, AUTH, PING, SHUTDOWN, REPLCONF, ROLE, CONFIG, SUBSCRIBE,
#    UNSUBSCRIBE, PSUBSCRIBE, PUNSUBSCRIBE, PUBLISH, PUBSUB, COMMAND, POST,
#    HOST and LATENCY.
#
replica-serve-stale-data yes

# You can configure a replica instance to accept writes or not. Writing against
# a replica instance may be useful to store some ephemeral data (because data
# written on a replica will be easily deleted after resync with the master) but
# may also cause problems if clients are writing to it because of a
# misconfiguration.
#
# Since Redis 2.6 by default replicas are read-only.
#
# Note: read only replicas are not designed to be exposed to untrusted clients
# on the internet. It's just a protection layer against misuse of the instance.
# Still a read only replica exports by default all the administrative commands
# such as CONFIG, DEBUG, and so forth. To a limited extent you can improve
# security of read only replicas using 'rename-command' to shadow all the
# administrative / dangerous commands.
replica-read-only yes

# Replication SYNC strategy: disk or socket.
#
# New replicas and reconnecting replicas that are not able to continue the
# replication process just receiving differences, need to do what is called a
# "full synchronization". An RDB file is transmitted from the master to the
# replicas.
#
# The transmission can happen in two different ways:
#
# 1) Disk-backed: The Redis master creates a new process that writes the RDB
#                 file on disk. Later the file is transferred by the parent
#                 process to the replicas incrementally.
# 2) Diskless: The Redis master creates a new process that directly writes the
#              RDB file to replica sockets, without touching the disk at all.
#
# With disk-backed replication, while the RDB file is generated, more replicas
# can be queued and served with the RDB file as soon as the current child
# producing the RDB file finishes its work. With diskless replication instead
# once the transfer starts, new replicas arriving will be queued and a new
# transfer will start when the current one terminates.
#
# When diskless replication is used, the master waits a configurable amount of
# time (in seconds) before starting the transfer in the hope that multiple
# replicas will arrive and the transfer can be parallelized.
#
# With slow disks and fast (large bandwidth) networks, diskless replication
# works better.
repl-diskless-sync no

# When diskless replication is enabled, it is possible to configure the delay
# the server waits in order to spawn the child that transfers the RDB via socket
# to the replicas.
#
# This is important since once the transfer starts, it is not possible to serve
# new replicas arriving, that will be queued for the next RDB transfer, so the
# server waits a delay in order to let more replicas arrive.
#
# The delay is specified in seconds, and by default is 5 seconds. To disable
# it entirely just set it to 0 seconds and the transfer will start ASAP.
repl-diskless-sync-delay 5

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# WARNING: RDB diskless load is experimental. Since in this setup the replica
# does not immediately store an RDB on disk, it may cause data loss during
# failovers. RDB diskless load + Redis modules not handling I/O reads may also
# cause Redis to abort in case of I/O errors during the initial synchronization
# stage with the master. Use only if you know what you are doing.
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Replica can load the RDB it reads from the replication link directly from the
# socket, or store the RDB to a file and read that file after it was completely
# received from the master.
#
# In many cases the disk is slower than the network, and storing and loading
# the RDB file may increase replication time (and even increase the master's
# Copy on Write memory and salve buffers).
# However, parsing the RDB file directly from the socket may mean that we have
# to flush the contents of the current database before the full rdb was
# received. For this reason we have the following options:
#
# "disabled"    - Don't use diskless load (store the rdb file to the disk first)
# "on-empty-db" - Use diskless load only when it is completely safe.
# "swapdb"      - Keep a copy of the current db contents in RAM while parsing
#                 the data directly from the socket. note that this requires
#                 sufficient memory, if you don't have it, you risk an OOM kill.
repl-diskless-load disabled

# Replicas send PINGs to server in a predefined interval. It's possible to
# change this interval with the repl_ping_replica_period option. The default
# value is 10 seconds.
#
# repl-ping-replica-period 10

# The following option sets the replication timeout for:
#
# 1) Bulk transfer I/O during SYNC, from the point of view of replica.
# 2) Master timeout from the point of view of replicas (data, pings).
# 3) Replica timeout from the point of view of masters (REPLCONF ACK pings).
#
# It is important to make sure that this value is greater than the value
# specified for repl-ping-replica-period otherwise a timeout will be detected
# every time there is low traffic between the master and the replica. The default
# value is 60 seconds.
#
# repl-timeout 60

# Disable TCP_NODELAY on the replica socket after SYNC?
#
# If you select "yes" Redis will use a smaller number of TCP packets and
# less bandwidth to send data to replicas. But this can add a delay for
# the data to appear on the replica side, up to 40 milliseconds with
# Linux kernels using a default configuration.
#
# If you select "no" the delay for data to appear on the replica side will
# be reduced but more bandwidth will be used for replication.
#
# By default we optimize for low latency, but in very high traffic conditions
# or when the master and replicas are many hops away, turning this to "yes" may
# be a good idea.
repl-disable-tcp-nodelay no

# Set the replication backlog size. The backlog is a buffer that accumulates
# replica data when replicas are disconnected for some time, so that when a
# replica wants to reconnect again, often a full resync is not needed, but a
# partial resync is enough, just passing the portion of data the replica
# missed while disconnected.
#
# The bigger the replication backlog, the longer the replica can endure the
# disconnect and later be able to perform a partial resynchronization.
#
# The backlog is only allocated if there is at least one replica connected.
#
# repl-backlog-size 1mb

# After a master has no connected replicas for some time, the backlog will be
# freed. The following option configures the amount of seconds that need to
# elapse, starting from the time the last replica disconnected, for the backlog
# buffer to be freed.
#
# Note that replicas never free the backlog for timeout, since they may be
# promoted to masters later, and should be able to correctly "partially
# resynchronize" with other replicas: hence they should always accumulate backlog.
#
# A value of 0 means to never release the backlog.
#
# repl-backlog-ttl 3600

# The replica priority is an integer number published by Redis in the INFO
# output. It is used by Redis Sentinel in order to select a replica to promote
# into a master if the master is no longer working correctly.
#
# A replica with a low priority number is considered better for promotion, so
# for instance if there are three replicas with priority 10, 100, 25 Sentinel
# will pick the one with priority 10, that is the lowest.
#
# However a special priority of 0 marks the replica as not able to perform the
# role of master, so a replica with priority of 0 will never be selected by
# Redis Sentinel for promotion.
#
# By default the priority is 100.
replica-priority 100

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# By default, Redis Sentinel includes all replicas in its reports. A replica
# can be excluded from Redis Sentinel's announcements. An unannounced replica
# will be ignored by the 'sentinel replicas <master>' command and won't be
# exposed to Redis Sentinel's clients.
#
# This option does not change the behavior of replica-priority. Even with
# replica-announced set to 'no', the replica can be promoted to master. To
# prevent this behavior, set replica-priority to 0.
#
# replica-announced yes

# It is possible for a master to stop accepting writes if there are less than
# N replicas connected, having a lag less or equal than M seconds.
#
# The N replicas need to be in "online" state.
#
# The lag in seconds, that must be <= the specified value, is calculated from
# the last ping received from the replica, that is usually sent every second.
#
# This option does not GUARANTEE that N replicas will accept the write, but
# will limit the window of exposure for lost writes in case not enough replicas
# are available, to the specified number of seconds.
#
# For example to require at least 3 replicas with a lag <= 10 seconds use:
#
# min-replicas-to-write 3
# min-replicas-max-lag 10
#
# Setting one or the other to 0 disables the feature.
#
# By default min-replicas-to-write is set to 0 (feature disabled) and
# min-replicas-max-lag is set to 10.

# A Redis master is able to list the address and port of the attached
# replicas in different ways. For example the "INFO replication" section
# offers this information, which is used, among other tools, by
# Redis Sentinel in order to discover replica instances.
# Another place where this info is available is in the output of the
# "ROLE" command of a master.
#
# The listed IP address and port normally reported by a replica is
# obtained in the following way:
#
#   IP: The address is auto detected by checking the peer address
#   of the socket used by the replica to connect with the master.
#
#   Port: The port is communicated by the replica during the replication
#   handshake, and is normally the port that the replica is using to
#   listen for connections.
#
# However when port forwarding or Network Address Translation (NAT) is
# used, the replica may actually be reachable via different IP and port
# pairs. The following two options can be used by a replica in order to
# report to its master a specific set of IP and port, so that both INFO
# and ROLE will report those values.
#
# There is no need to use both the options if you need to override just
# the port or the IP address.

############################### KEYS TRACKING #################################

# Redis implements server assisted support for client side caching of values.
# This is implemented using an invalidation table that remembers, using
# a radix key indexed by key name, what clients have which keys. In turn
# this is used in order to send invalidation messages to clients. Please
# check this page to understand more about the feature:
#
#   https://redis.io/topics/client-side-caching
#
# When tracking is enabled for a client, all the read only queries are assumed
# to be cached: this will force Redis to store information in the invalidation
# table. When keys are modified, such information is flushed away, and
# invalidation messages are sent to the clients. However if the workload is
# heavily dominated by reads, Redis could use more and more memory in order
# to track the keys fetched by many clients.
#
# For this reason it is possible to configure a maximum fill value for the
# invalidation table. By default it is set to 1M of keys, and once this limit
# is reached, Redis will start to evict keys in the invalidation table
# even if they were not modified, just to reclaim memory: this will in turn
# force the clients to invalidate the cached values. Basically the table
# maximum size is a trade off between the memory you want to spend server
# side to track information about who cached what, and the ability of clients
# to retain cached objects in memory.
#
# If you set the value to 0, it means there are no limits, and Redis will
# retain as many keys as needed in the invalidation table.
# In the "stats" INFO section, you can find information about the number of
# keys in the invalidation table at every given moment.
#
# Note: when key tracking is used in broadcasting mode, no memory is used
# in the server side so this setting is useless.
#
# tracking-table-max-keys 1000000

################################## SECURITY ###################################

# Warning: since Redis is pretty fast, an outside user can try up to
# 1 million passwords per second against a modern box. This means that you
# should use very strong passwords, otherwise they will be very easy to break.
# Note that because the password is really a shared secret between the client
# and the server, and should not be memorized by any human, the password
# can be easily a long string from /dev/urandom or whatever, so by using a
# long and unguessable password no brute force attack will be possible.

# Redis ACL users are defined in the following format:
#
#   user <username> ... acl rules ...
#
# For example:
#
#   user worker +@list +@connection ~jobs:* on >ffa9203c493aa99
#
# The special username "default" is used for new connections. If this user
# has the "nopass" rule, then new connections will be immediately authenticated
# as the "default" user without the need of any password provided via the
# AUTH command. Otherwise if the "default" user is not flagged with "nopass"
# the connections will start in not authenticated state, and will require
# AUTH (or the HELLO command AUTH option) in order to be authenticated and
# start to work.
#
# The ACL rules that describe what a user can do are the following:
#
#  on           Enable the user: it is possible to authenticate as this user.
#  off          Disable the user: it's no longer possible to authenticate
#               with this user, however the already authenticated connections
#               will still work.
#  skip-sanitize-payload    RESTORE dump-payload sanitation is skipped.
#  sanitize-payload         RESTORE dump-payload is sanitized (default).
#  +<command>   Allow the execution of that command
#  -<command>   Disallow the execution of that command
#  +@<category> Allow the execution of all the commands in such category
#               with valid categories are like @admin, @set, @sortedset, ...
#               and so forth, see the full list in the server.c file where
#               the Redis command table is described and defined.
#               The special category @all means all the commands, but currently
#               present in the server, and that will be loaded in the future
#               via modules.
#  +<command>|subcommand    Allow a specific subcommand of an otherwise
#                           disabled command. Note that this form is not
#                           allowed as negative like -DEBUG|SEGFAULT, but
#                           only additive starting with "+".
#  allcommands  Alias for +@all. Note that it implies the ability to execute
#               all the future commands loaded via the modules system.
#  nocommands   Alias for -@all.
#  ~<pattern>   Add a pattern of keys that can be mentioned as part of
#               commands. For instance ~* allows all the keys. The pattern
#               is a glob-style pattern like the one of KEYS.
#               It is possible to specify multiple patterns.
#  allkeys      Alias for ~*
#  resetkeys    Flush the list of allowed keys patterns.
#  &<pattern>   Add a glob-style pattern of Pub/Sub channels that can be
#               accessed by the user. It is possible to specify multiple channel
#               patterns.
#  allchannels  Alias for &*
#  resetchannels            Flush the list of allowed channel patterns.
#  ><password>  Add this password to the list of valid password for the user.
#               For example >mypass will add "mypass" to the list.
#               This directive clears the "nopass" flag (see later).
#  <<password>  Remove this password from the list of valid passwords.
#  nopass       All the set passwords of the user are removed, and the user
#               is flagged as requiring no password: it means that every
#               password will work against this user. If this directive is
#               used for the default user, every new connection will be
#               immediately authenticated with the default user without
#               any explicit AUTH command required. Note that the "resetpass"
#               directive will clear this condition.
#  resetpass    Flush the list of allowed passwords. Moreover removes the
#               "nopass" status. After "resetpass" the user has no associated
#               passwords and there is no way to authenticate without adding
#               some password (or setting it as "nopass" later).
#  reset        Performs the following actions: resetpass, resetkeys, off,
#               -@all. The user returns to the same state it has immediately
#               after its creation.
#
# ACL rules can be specified in any order: for instance you can start with
# passwords, then flags, or key patterns. However note that the additive
# and subtractive rules will CHANGE MEANING depending on the ordering.
# For instance see the following example:
#
#   user alice on +@all -DEBUG ~* >somepassword
#
# This will allow "alice" to use all the commands with the exception of the
# DEBUG command, since +@all added all the commands to the set of the commands
# alice can use, and later DEBUG was removed. However if we invert the order
# of two ACL rules the result will be different:
#
#   user alice on -DEBUG +@all ~* >somepassword
#
# Now DEBUG was removed when alice had yet no commands in the set of allowed
# commands, later all the commands are added, so the user will be able to
# execute everything.
#
# Basically ACL rules are processed left-to-right.
#
# For more information about ACL configuration please refer to
# the Redis web site at https://redis.io/topics/acl

# ACL LOG
#
# The ACL Log tracks failed commands and authentication events associated
# with ACLs. The ACL Log is useful to troubleshoot failed commands blocked 
# by ACLs. The ACL Log is stored in memory. You can reclaim memory with 
# ACL LOG RESET. Define the maximum entry length of the ACL Log below.
acllog-max-len 128

# Using an external ACL file
#
# Instead of configuring users here in this file, it is possible to use
# a stand-alone file just listing users. The two methods cannot be mixed:
# if you configure users here and at the same time you activate the external
# ACL file, the server will refuse to start.
#
# The format of the external ACL user file is exactly the same as the
# format that is used inside redis.conf to describe users.
#
# aclfile /etc/redis/users.acl

# IMPORTANT NOTE: starting with Redis 6 "requirepass" is just a compatibility
# layer on top of the new ACL system. The option effect will be just setting
# the password for the default user. Clients will still authenticate using
# AUTH <password> as usually, or more explicitly with AUTH default <password>
# if they follow the new protocol: both will work.
#
# The requirepass is not compatable with aclfile option and the ACL LOAD
# command, these will cause requirepass to be ignored.
#
requirepass leadnews

# New users are initialized with restrictive permissions by default, via the
# equivalent of this ACL rule 'off resetkeys -@all'. Starting with Redis 6.2, it
# is possible to manage access to Pub/Sub channels with ACL rules as well. The
# default Pub/Sub channels permission if new users is controlled by the 
# acl-pubsub-default configuration directive, which accepts one of these values:
#
# allchannels: grants access to all Pub/Sub channels
# resetchannels: revokes access to all Pub/Sub channels
#
# To ensure backward compatibility while upgrading Redis 6.0, acl-pubsub-default
# defaults to the 'allchannels' permission.
#
# Future compatibility note: it is very likely that in a future version of Redis
# the directive's default of 'allchannels' will be changed to 'resetchannels' in
# order to provide better out-of-the-box Pub/Sub security. Therefore, it is
# recommended that you explicitly define Pub/Sub permissions for all users
# rather then rely on implicit default values. Once you've set explicit
# Pub/Sub for all existing users, you should uncomment the following line.
#
# acl-pubsub-default resetchannels

# Command renaming (DEPRECATED).
#
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------
# WARNING: avoid using this option if possible. Instead use ACLs to remove
# commands from the default user, and put them only in some admin user you
# create for administrative purposes.
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# It is possible to change the name of dangerous commands in a shared
# environment. For instance the CONFIG command may be renamed into something
# hard to guess so that it will still be available for internal-use tools
# but not available for general clients.
#
# Example:
#
# rename-command CONFIG b840fc02d524045429941cc15f59e41cb7be6c52
#
# It is also possible to completely kill a command by renaming it into
# an empty string:
#
# rename-command CONFIG ""
#
# Please note that changing the name of commands that are logged into the
# AOF file or transmitted to replicas may cause problems.

################################### CLIENTS ####################################

# Set the max number of connected clients at the same time. By default
# this limit is set to 10000 clients, however if the Redis server is not
# able to configure the process file limit to allow for the specified limit
# the max number of allowed clients is set to the current file limit
# minus 32 (as Redis reserves a few file descriptors for internal uses).
#
# Once the limit is reached Redis will close all the new connections sending
# an error 'max number of clients reached'.
#
# IMPORTANT: When Redis Cluster is used, the max number of connections is also
# shared with the cluster bus: every node in the cluster will use two
# connections, one incoming and another outgoing. It is important to size the
# limit accordingly in case of very large clusters.
#
# maxclients 10000

############################## MEMORY MANAGEMENT ################################

# Set a memory usage limit to the specified amount of bytes.
# When the memory limit is reached Redis will try to remove keys
# according to the eviction policy selected (see maxmemory-policy).
#
# If Redis can't remove keys according to the policy, or if the policy is
# set to 'noeviction', Redis will start to reply with errors to commands
# that would use more memory, like SET, LPUSH, and so on, and will continue
# to reply to read-only commands like GET.
#
# This option is usually useful when using Redis as an LRU or LFU cache, or to
# set a hard memory limit for an instance (using the 'noeviction' policy).
#
# WARNING: If you have replicas attached to an instance with maxmemory on,
# the size of the output buffers needed to feed the replicas are subtracted
# from the used memory count, so that network problems / resyncs will
# not trigger a loop where keys are evicted, and in turn the output
# buffer of replicas is full with DELs of keys evicted triggering the deletion
# of more keys, and so forth until the database is completely emptied.
#
# In short... if you have replicas attached it is suggested that you set a lower
# limit for maxmemory so that there is some free RAM on the system for replica
# output buffers (but this is not needed if the policy is 'noeviction').
#
# maxmemory <bytes>

# MAXMEMORY POLICY: how Redis will select what to remove when maxmemory
# is reached. You can select one from the following behaviors:
#
# volatile-lru -> Evict using approximated LRU, only keys with an expire set.
# allkeys-lru -> Evict any key using approximated LRU.
# volatile-lfu -> Evict using approximated LFU, only keys with an expire set.
# allkeys-lfu -> Evict any key using approximated LFU.
# volatile-random -> Remove a random key having an expire set.
# allkeys-random -> Remove a random key, any key.
# volatile-ttl -> Remove the key with the nearest expire time (minor TTL)
# noeviction -> Don't evict anything, just return an error on write operations.
#
# LRU means Least Recently Used
# LFU means Least Frequently Used
#
# Both LRU, LFU and volatile-ttl are implemented using approximated
# randomized algorithms.
#
# Note: with any of the above policies, when there are no suitable keys for
# eviction, Redis will return an error on write operations that require
# more memory. These are usually commands that create new keys, add data or
# modify existing keys. A few examples are: SET, INCR, HSET, LPUSH, SUNIONSTORE,
# SORT (due to the STORE argument), and EXEC (if the transaction includes any
# command that requires memory).
#
# The default is:
#
# maxmemory-policy noeviction

# LRU, LFU and minimal TTL algorithms are not precise algorithms but approximated
# algorithms (in order to save memory), so you can tune it for speed or
# accuracy. By default Redis will check five keys and pick the one that was
# used least recently, you can change the sample size using the following
# configuration directive.
#
# The default of 5 produces good enough results. 10 Approximates very closely
# true LRU but costs more CPU. 3 is faster but not very accurate.
#
# maxmemory-samples 5

# Eviction processing is designed to function well with the default setting.
# If there is an unusually large amount of write traffic, this value may need to
# be increased.  Decreasing this value may reduce latency at the risk of 
# eviction processing effectiveness
#   0 = minimum latency, 10 = default, 100 = process without regard to latency
#
# maxmemory-eviction-tenacity 10

# Starting from Redis 5, by default a replica will ignore its maxmemory setting
# (unless it is promoted to master after a failover or manually). It means
# that the eviction of keys will be just handled by the master, sending the
# DEL commands to the replica as keys evict in the master side.
#
# This behavior ensures that masters and replicas stay consistent, and is usually
# what you want, however if your replica is writable, or you want the replica
# to have a different memory setting, and you are sure all the writes performed
# to the replica are idempotent, then you may change this default (but be sure
# to understand what you are doing).
#
# Note that since the replica by default does not evict, it may end using more
# memory than the one set via maxmemory (there are certain buffers that may
# be larger on the replica, or data structures may sometimes take more memory
# and so forth). So make sure you monitor your replicas and make sure they
# have enough memory to never hit a real out-of-memory condition before the
# master hits the configured maxmemory setting.
#
# replica-ignore-maxmemory yes

# Redis reclaims expired keys in two ways: upon access when those keys are
# found to be expired, and also in background, in what is called the
# "active expire key". The key space is slowly and interactively scanned
# looking for expired keys to reclaim, so that it is possible to free memory
# of keys that are expired and will never be accessed again in a short time.
#
# The default effort of the expire cycle will try to avoid having more than
# ten percent of expired keys still in memory, and will try to avoid consuming
# more than 25% of total memory and to add latency to the system. However
# it is possible to increase the expire "effort" that is normally set to
# "1", to a greater value, up to the value "10". At its maximum value the
# system will use more CPU, longer cycles (and technically may introduce
# more latency), and will tolerate less already expired keys still present
# in the system. It's a tradeoff between memory, CPU and latency.
#
# active-expire-effort 1

############################# LAZY FREEING ####################################

# Redis has two primitives to delete keys. One is called DEL and is a blocking
# deletion of the object. It means that the server stops processing new commands
# in order to reclaim all the memory associated with an object in a synchronous
# way. If the key deleted is associated with a small object, the time needed
# in order to execute the DEL command is very small and comparable to most other
# O(1) or O(log_N) commands in Redis. However if the key is associated with an
# aggregated value containing millions of elements, the server can block for
# a long time (even seconds) in order to complete the operation.
#
# For the above reasons Redis also offers non blocking deletion primitives
# such as UNLINK (non blocking DEL) and the ASYNC option of FLUSHALL and
# FLUSHDB commands, in order to reclaim memory in background. Those commands
# are executed in constant time. Another thread will incrementally free the
# object in the background as fast as possible.
#
# DEL, UNLINK and ASYNC option of FLUSHALL and FLUSHDB are user-controlled.
# It's up to the design of the application to understand when it is a good
# idea to use one or the other. However the Redis server sometimes has to
# delete keys or flush the whole database as a side effect of other operations.
# Specifically Redis deletes objects independently of a user call in the
# following scenarios:
#
# 1) On eviction, because of the maxmemory and maxmemory policy configurations,
#    in order to make room for new data, without going over the specified
#    memory limit.
# 2) Because of expire: when a key with an associated time to live (see the
#    EXPIRE command) must be deleted from memory.
# 3) Because of a side effect of a command that stores data on a key that may
#    already exist. For example the RENAME command may delete the old key
#    content when it is replaced with another one. Similarly SUNIONSTORE
#    or SORT with STORE option may delete existing keys. The SET command
#    itself removes any old content of the specified key in order to replace
#    it with the specified string.
# 4) During replication, when a replica performs a full resynchronization with
#    its master, the content of the whole database is removed in order to
#    load the RDB file just transferred.
#
# In all the above cases the default is to delete objects in a blocking way,
# like if DEL was called. However you can configure each case specifically
# in order to instead release memory in a non-blocking way like if UNLINK
# was called, using the following configuration directives.

lazyfree-lazy-eviction no
lazyfree-lazy-expire no
lazyfree-lazy-server-del no
replica-lazy-flush no

# It is also possible, for the case when to replace the user code DEL calls
# with UNLINK calls is not easy, to modify the default behavior of the DEL
# command to act exactly like UNLINK, using the following configuration
# directive:

lazyfree-lazy-user-del no

# FLUSHDB, FLUSHALL, and SCRIPT FLUSH support both asynchronous and synchronous
# deletion, which can be controlled by passing the [SYNC|ASYNC] flags into the
# commands. When neither flag is passed, this directive will be used to determine
# if the data should be deleted asynchronously.

lazyfree-lazy-user-flush no

################################ THREADED I/O #################################

# Redis is mostly single threaded, however there are certain threaded
# operations such as UNLINK, slow I/O accesses and other things that are
# performed on side threads.
#
# Now it is also possible to handle Redis clients socket reads and writes
# in different I/O threads. Since especially writing is so slow, normally
# Redis users use pipelining in order to speed up the Redis performances per
# core, and spawn multiple instances in order to scale more. Using I/O
# threads it is possible to easily speedup two times Redis without resorting
# to pipelining nor sharding of the instance.
#
# By default threading is disabled, we suggest enabling it only in machines
# that have at least 4 or more cores, leaving at least one spare core.
# Using more than 8 threads is unlikely to help much. We also recommend using
# threaded I/O only if you actually have performance problems, with Redis
# instances being able to use a quite big percentage of CPU time, otherwise
# there is no point in using this feature.
#
# So for instance if you have a four cores boxes, try to use 2 or 3 I/O
# threads, if you have a 8 cores, try to use 6 threads. In order to
# enable I/O threads use the following configuration directive:
#
# io-threads 4
#
# Setting io-threads to 1 will just use the main thread as usual.
# When I/O threads are enabled, we only use threads for writes, that is
# to thread the write(2) syscall and transfer the client buffers to the
# socket. However it is also possible to enable threading of reads and
# protocol parsing using the following configuration directive, by setting
# it to yes:
#
# io-threads-do-reads no
#
# Usually threading reads doesn't help much.
#
# NOTE 1: This configuration directive cannot be changed at runtime via
# CONFIG SET. Aso this feature currently does not work when SSL is
# enabled.
#
# NOTE 2: If you want to test the Redis speedup using redis-benchmark, make
# sure you also run the benchmark itself in threaded mode, using the
# --threads option to match the number of Redis threads, otherwise you'll not
# be able to notice the improvements.

############################ KERNEL OOM CONTROL ##############################

# On Linux, it is possible to hint the kernel OOM killer on what processes
# should be killed first when out of memory.
#
# Enabling this feature makes Redis actively control the oom_score_adj value
# for all its processes, depending on their role. The default scores will
# attempt to have background child processes killed before all others, and
# replicas killed before masters.
#
# Redis supports three options:
#
# no:       Don't make changes to oom-score-adj (default).
# yes:      Alias to "relative" see below.
# absolute: Values in oom-score-adj-values are written as is to the kernel.

############################## APPEND ONLY MODE ###############################

# By default Redis asynchronously dumps the dataset on disk. This mode is
# good enough in many applications, but an issue with the Redis process or
# a power outage may result into a few minutes of writes lost (depending on
# the configured save points).
#
# The Append Only File is an alternative persistence mode that provides
# much better durability. For instance using the default data fsync policy
# (see later in the config file) Redis can lose just one second of writes in a
# dramatic event like a server power outage, or a single write if something
# wrong with the Redis process itself happens, but the operating system is
# still running correctly.
#
# AOF and RDB persistence can be enabled at the same time without problems.
# If the AOF is enabled on startup Redis will load the AOF, that is the file
# with the better durability guarantees.
#
# Please check https://redis.io/topics/persistence for more information.

appendonly yes

# The name of the append only file (default: "appendonly.aof")

appendfilename "appendonly.aof"

# The fsync() call tells the Operating System to actually write data on disk
# instead of waiting for more data in the output buffer. Some OS will really flush
# data on disk, some other OS will just try to do it ASAP.
#
# Redis supports three different modes:
#
# no: don't fsync, just let the OS flush the data when it wants. Faster.
# always: fsync after every write to the append only log. Slow, Safest.
# everysec: fsync only one time every second. Compromise.
#
# The default is "everysec", as that's usually the right compromise between
# speed and data safety. It's up to you to understand if you can relax this to
# "no" that will let the operating system flush the output buffer when
# it wants, for better performances (but if you can live with the idea of
# some data loss consider the default persistence mode that's snapshotting),
# or on the contrary, use "always" that's very slow but a bit safer than
# everysec.
#
# More details please check the following article:
# http://antirez.com/post/redis-persistence-demystified.html
#
# If unsure, use "everysec".

# appendfsync always
appendfsync everysec
# appendfsync no

# When the AOF fsync policy is set to always or everysec, and a background
# saving process (a background save or AOF log background rewriting) is
# performing a lot of I/O against the disk, in some Linux configurations
# Redis may block too long on the fsync() call. Note that there is no fix for
# this currently, as even performing fsync in a different thread will block
# our synchronous write(2) call.
#
# In order to mitigate this problem it's possible to use the following option
# that will prevent fsync() from being called in the main process while a
# BGSAVE or BGREWRITEAOF is in progress.
#
# This means that while another child is saving, the durability of Redis is
# the same as "appendfsync none". In practical terms, this means that it is
# possible to lose up to 30 seconds of log in the worst scenario (with the
# default Linux settings).
#
# If you have latency problems turn this to "yes". Otherwise leave it as
# "no" that is the safest pick from the point of view of durability.

no-appendfsync-on-rewrite no

# Automatic rewrite of the append only file.
# Redis is able to automatically rewrite the log file implicitly calling
# BGREWRITEAOF when the AOF log size grows by the specified percentage.
#
# This is how it works: Redis remembers the size of the AOF file after the
# latest rewrite (if no rewrite has happened since the restart, the size of
# the AOF at startup is used).
#
# This base size is compared to the current size. If the current size is
# bigger than the specified percentage, the rewrite is triggered. Also
# you need to specify a minimal size for the AOF file to be rewritten, this
# is useful to avoid rewriting the AOF file even if the percentage increase
# is reached but it is still pretty small.
#
# Specify a percentage of zero in order to disable the automatic AOF
# rewrite feature.

auto-aof-rewrite-percentage 100
auto-aof-rewrite-min-size 64mb

# An AOF file may be found to be truncated at the end during the Redis
# startup process, when the AOF data gets loaded back into memory.
# This may happen when the system where Redis is running
# crashes, especially when an ext4 filesystem is mounted without the
# data=ordered option (however this can't happen when Redis itself
# crashes or aborts but the operating system still works correctly).
#
# Redis can either exit with an error when this happens, or load as much
# data as possible (the default now) and start if the AOF file is found
# to be truncated at the end. The following option controls this behavior.
#
# If aof-load-truncated is set to yes, a truncated AOF file is loaded and
# the Redis server starts emitting a log to inform the user of the event.
# Otherwise if the option is set to no, the server aborts with an error
# and refuses to start. When the option is set to no, the user requires
# to fix the AOF file using the "redis-check-aof" utility before to restart
# the server.
#
# Note that if the AOF file will be found to be corrupted in the middle
# the server will still exit with an error. This option only applies when
# Redis will try to read more data from the AOF file but not enough bytes
# will be found.
aof-load-truncated yes

# When rewriting the AOF file, Redis is able to use an RDB preamble in the
# AOF file for faster rewrites and recoveries. When this option is turned
# on the rewritten AOF file is composed of two different stanzas:
#
#   [RDB file][AOF tail]
#
# When loading, Redis recognizes that the AOF file starts with the "REDIS"
# string and loads the prefixed RDB file, then continues loading the AOF
# tail.
aof-use-rdb-preamble yes

################################ LUA SCRIPTING  ###############################

# Max execution time of a Lua script in milliseconds.
#
# If the maximum execution time is reached Redis will log that a script is
# still in execution after the maximum allowed time and will start to
# reply to queries with an error.
#
# When a long running script exceeds the maximum execution time only the
# SCRIPT KILL and SHUTDOWN NOSAVE commands are available. The first can be
# used to stop a script that did not yet call any write commands. The second
# is the only way to shut down the server in the case a write command was
# already issued by the script but the user doesn't want to wait for the natural
# termination of the script.
#
# Set it to 0 or a negative value for unlimited execution without warnings.

################################ REDIS CLUSTER  ###############################

# Normal Redis instances can't be part of a Redis Cluster; only nodes that are
# started as cluster nodes can. In order to start a Redis instance as a
# cluster node enable the cluster support uncommenting the following:
#
# cluster-enabled yes

# Every cluster node has a cluster configuration file. This file is not
# intended to be edited by hand. It is created and updated by Redis nodes.
# Every Redis Cluster node requires a different cluster configuration file.
# Make sure that instances running in the same system do not have
# overlapping cluster configuration file names.
#
# cluster-config-file nodes-6379.conf

# Cluster node timeout is the amount of milliseconds a node must be unreachable
# for it to be considered in failure state.
# Most other internal time limits are a multiple of the node timeout.
#
# cluster-node-timeout 15000

# A replica of a failing master will avoid to start a failover if its data
# looks too old.
#
# There is no simple way for a replica to actually have an exact measure of
# its "data age", so the following two checks are performed:
#
# 1) If there are multiple replicas able to failover, they exchange messages
#    in order to try to give an advantage to the replica with the best
#    replication offset (more data from the master processed).
#    Replicas will try to get their rank by offset, and apply to the start
#    of the failover a delay proportional to their rank.
#
# 2) Every single replica computes the time of the last interaction with
#    its master. This can be the last ping or command received (if the master
#    is still in the "connected" state), or the time that elapsed since the
#    disconnection with the master (if the replication link is currently down).
#    If the last interaction is too old, the replica will not try to failover
#    at all.
#
# The point "2" can be tuned by user. Specifically a replica will not perform
# the failover if, since the last interaction with the master, the time
# elapsed is greater than:
#
#   (node-timeout * cluster-replica-validity-factor) + repl-ping-replica-period
#
# So for example if node-timeout is 30 seconds, and the cluster-replica-validity-factor
# is 10, and assuming a default repl-ping-replica-period of 10 seconds, the
# replica will not try to failover if it was not able to talk with the master
# for longer than 310 seconds.
#
# A large cluster-replica-validity-factor may allow replicas with too old data to failover
# a master, while a too small value may prevent the cluster from being able to
# elect a replica at all.
#
# For maximum availability, it is possible to set the cluster-replica-validity-factor
# to a value of 0, which means, that replicas will always try to failover the
# master regardless of the last time they interacted with the master.
# (However they'll always try to apply a delay proportional to their
# offset rank).
#
# Zero is the only value able to guarantee that when all the partitions heal
# the cluster will always be able to continue.
#
# cluster-replica-validity-factor 10

# Cluster replicas are able to migrate to orphaned masters, that are masters
# that are left without working replicas. This improves the cluster ability
# to resist to failures as otherwise an orphaned master can't be failed over
# in case of failure if it has no working replicas.
#
# Replicas migrate to orphaned masters only if there are still at least a
# given number of other working replicas for their old master. This number
# is the "migration barrier". A migration barrier of 1 means that a replica
# will migrate only if there is at least 1 other working replica for its master
# and so forth. It usually reflects the number of replicas you want for every
# master in your cluster.
#
# Default is 1 (replicas migrate only if their masters remain with at least
# one replica). To disable migration just set it to a very large value or
# set cluster-allow-replica-migration to 'no'.
# A value of 0 can be set but is useful only for debugging and dangerous
# in production.
#
# cluster-migration-barrier 1

# Turning off this option allows to use less automatic cluster configuration.
# It both disables migration to orphaned masters and migration from masters
# that became empty.
#
# Default is 'yes' (allow automatic migrations).
#
# cluster-allow-replica-migration yes

# By default Redis Cluster nodes stop accepting queries if they detect there
# is at least a hash slot uncovered (no available node is serving it).
# This way if the cluster is partially down (for example a range of hash slots
# are no longer covered) all the cluster becomes, eventually, unavailable.
# It automatically returns available as soon as all the slots are covered again.
#
# However sometimes you want the subset of the cluster which is working,
# to continue to accept queries for the part of the key space that is still
# covered. In order to do so, just set the cluster-require-full-coverage
# option to no.
#
# cluster-require-full-coverage yes

# This option, when set to yes, prevents replicas from trying to failover its
# master during master failures. However the replica can still perform a
# manual failover, if forced to do so.
#
# This is useful in different scenarios, especially in the case of multiple
# data center operations, where we want one side to never be promoted if not
# in the case of a total DC failure.
#
# cluster-replica-no-failover no

# This option, when set to yes, allows nodes to serve read traffic while the
# the cluster is in a down state, as long as it believes it owns the slots. 
#
# This is useful for two cases.  The first case is for when an application 
# doesn't require consistency of data during node failures or network partitions.
# One example of this is a cache, where as long as the node has the data it
# should be able to serve it. 
#
# The second use case is for configurations that don't meet the recommended  
# three shards but want to enable cluster mode and scale later. A 
# master outage in a 1 or 2 shard configuration causes a read/write outage to the
# entire cluster without this option set, with it set there is only a write outage.
# Without a quorum of masters, slot ownership will not change automatically. 
#
# cluster-allow-reads-when-down no

# In order to setup your cluster make sure to read the documentation
# available at https://redis.io web site.

########################## CLUSTER DOCKER/NAT support  ########################

# In certain deployments, Redis Cluster nodes address discovery fails, because
# addresses are NAT-ted or because ports are forwarded (the typical case is
# Docker and other containers).
#
# In order to make Redis Cluster working in such environments, a static
# configuration where each node knows its public address is needed. The
# following four options are used for this scope, and are:
#
# * cluster-announce-ip
# * cluster-announce-port
# * cluster-announce-tls-port
# * cluster-announce-bus-port
#
# Each instructs the node about its address, client ports (for connections
# without and with TLS) and cluster message bus port. The information is then
# published in the header of the bus packets so that other nodes will be able to
# correctly map the address of the node publishing the information.
#
# If cluster-tls is set to yes and cluster-announce-tls-port is omitted or set
# to zero, then cluster-announce-port refers to the TLS port. Note also that
# cluster-announce-tls-port has no effect if cluster-tls is set to no.
#
# If the above options are not used, the normal Redis Cluster auto-detection
# will be used instead.
#
# Note that when remapped, the bus port may not be at the fixed offset of
# clients port + 10000, so you can specify any port and bus-port depending
# on how they get remapped. If the bus-port is not set, a fixed offset of
# 10000 will be used as usual.
#
# Example:
#
# cluster-announce-ip 10.1.1.5
# cluster-announce-tls-port 6379
# cluster-announce-port 0
# cluster-announce-bus-port 6380

################################## SLOW LOG ###################################

# The Redis Slow Log is a system to log queries that exceeded a specified
# execution time. The execution time does not include the I/O operations
# like talking with the client, sending the reply and so forth,
# but just the time needed to actually execute the command (this is the only
# stage of command execution where the thread is blocked and can not serve
# other requests in the meantime).
#
# You can configure the slow log with two parameters: one tells Redis
# what is the execution time, in microseconds, to exceed in order for the
# command to get logged, and the other parameter is the length of the
# slow log. When a new command is logged the oldest one is removed from the
# queue of logged commands.

# The following time is expressed in microseconds, so 1000000 is equivalent
# to one second. Note that a negative number disables the slow log, while
# a value of zero forces the logging of every command.
slowlog-log-slower-than 10000

# There is no limit to this length. Just be aware that it will consume memory.
# You can reclaim memory used by the slow log with SLOWLOG RESET.
slowlog-max-len 128

################################ LATENCY MONITOR ##############################

# The Redis latency monitoring subsystem samples different operations
# at runtime in order to collect data related to possible sources of
# latency of a Redis instance.
#
# Via the LATENCY command this information is available to the user that can
# print graphs and obtain reports.
#
# The system only logs operations that were performed in a time equal or
# greater than the amount of milliseconds specified via the
# latency-monitor-threshold configuration directive. When its value is set
# to zero, the latency monitor is turned off.
#
# By default latency monitoring is disabled since it is mostly not needed
# if you don't have latency issues, and collecting data has a performance
# impact, that while very small, can be measured under big load. Latency
# monitoring can easily be enabled at runtime using the command
# "CONFIG SET latency-monitor-threshold <milliseconds>" if needed.
latency-monitor-threshold 0

############################# EVENT NOTIFICATION ##############################

# Redis can notify Pub/Sub clients about events happening in the key space.
# This feature is documented at https://redis.io/topics/notifications
#
# For instance if keyspace events notification is enabled, and a client
# performs a DEL operation on key "foo" stored in the Database 0, two
# messages will be published via Pub/Sub:
#
# PUBLISH __keyspace@0__:foo del
# PUBLISH __keyevent@0__:del foo
#
# It is possible to select the events that Redis will notify among a set
# of classes. Every class is identified by a single character:
#
#  K     Keyspace events, published with __keyspace@<db>__ prefix.
#  E     Keyevent events, published with __keyevent@<db>__ prefix.
#  g     Generic commands (non-type specific) like DEL, EXPIRE, RENAME, ...
#  $     String commands
#  l     List commands
#  s     Set commands
#  h     Hash commands
#  z     Sorted set commands
#  x     Expired events (events generated every time a key expires)
#  e     Evicted events (events generated when a key is evicted for maxmemory)
#  t     Stream commands
#  d     Module key type events
#  m     Key-miss events (Note: It is not included in the 'A' class)
#  A     Alias for g$lshzxetd, so that the "AKE" string means all the events
#        (Except key-miss events which are excluded from 'A' due to their
#         unique nature).
#
#  The "notify-keyspace-events" takes as argument a string that is composed
#  of zero or multiple characters. The empty string means that notifications
#  are disabled.
#
#  Example: to enable list and generic events, from the point of view of the
#           event name, use:
#
#  notify-keyspace-events Elg
#
#  Example 2: to get the stream of the expired keys subscribing to channel
#             name __keyevent@0__:expired use:
#
#  notify-keyspace-events Ex
#
#  By default all notifications are disabled because most users don't need
#  this feature and the feature has some overhead. Note that if you don't
#  specify at least one of K or E, no events will be delivered.

############################### GOPHER SERVER #################################

# Redis contains an implementation of the Gopher protocol, as specified in
# the RFC 1436 (https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1436.txt).
#
# The Gopher protocol was very popular in the late '90s. It is an alternative
# to the web, and the implementation both server and client side is so simple
# that the Redis server has just 100 lines of code in order to implement this
# support.
#
# What do you do with Gopher nowadays? Well Gopher never *really* died, and
# lately there is a movement in order for the Gopher more hierarchical content
# composed of just plain text documents to be resurrected. Some want a simpler
# internet, others believe that the mainstream internet became too much
# controlled, and it's cool to create an alternative space for people that
# want a bit of fresh air.
#
# Anyway for the 10nth birthday of the Redis, we gave it the Gopher protocol
# as a gift.
#
# --- HOW IT WORKS? ---
#
# The Redis Gopher support uses the inline protocol of Redis, and specifically
# two kind of inline requests that were anyway illegal: an empty request
# or any request that starts with "/" (there are no Redis commands starting
# with such a slash). Normal RESP2/RESP3 requests are completely out of the
# path of the Gopher protocol implementation and are served as usual as well.
#
# If you open a connection to Redis when Gopher is enabled and send it
# a string like "/foo", if there is a key named "/foo" it is served via the
# Gopher protocol.
#
# In order to create a real Gopher "hole" (the name of a Gopher site in Gopher
# talking), you likely need a script like the following:
#
#   https://github.com/antirez/gopher2redis
#
# --- SECURITY WARNING ---
#
# If you plan to put Redis on the internet in a publicly accessible address
# to server Gopher pages MAKE SURE TO SET A PASSWORD to the instance.
# Once a password is set:
#
#   1. The Gopher server (when enabled, not by default) will still serve
#      content via Gopher.
#   2. However other commands cannot be called before the client will
#      authenticate.
#
# So use the 'requirepass' option to protect your instance.
#
# Note that Gopher is not currently supported when 'io-threads-do-reads'
# is enabled.
#
# To enable Gopher support, uncomment the following line and set the option
# from no (the default) to yes.
#
# gopher-enabled no

############################### ADVANCED CONFIG ###############################

# Hashes are encoded using a memory efficient data structure when they have a
# small number of entries, and the biggest entry does not exceed a given
# threshold. These thresholds can be configured using the following directives.
hash-max-ziplist-entries 512
hash-max-ziplist-value 64

# Lists are also encoded in a special way to save a lot of space.
# The number of entries allowed per internal list node can be specified
# as a fixed maximum size or a maximum number of elements.
# For a fixed maximum size, use -5 through -1, meaning:
# -5: max size: 64 Kb  <-- not recommended for normal workloads
# -4: max size: 32 Kb  <-- not recommended
# -3: max size: 16 Kb  <-- probably not recommended
# -2: max size: 8 Kb   <-- good
# -1: max size: 4 Kb   <-- good
# Positive numbers mean store up to _exactly_ that number of elements
# per list node.
# The highest performing option is usually -2 (8 Kb size) or -1 (4 Kb size),
# but if your use case is unique, adjust the settings as necessary.
list-max-ziplist-size -2

# Lists may also be compressed.
# Compress depth is the number of quicklist ziplist nodes from *each* side of
# the list to *exclude* from compression.  The head and tail of the list
# are always uncompressed for fast push/pop operations.  Settings are:
# 0: disable all list compression
# 1: depth 1 means "don't start compressing until after 1 node into the list,
#    going from either the head or tail"
#    So: [head]->node->node->...->node->[tail]
#    [head], [tail] will always be uncompressed; inner nodes will compress.
# 2: [head]->[next]->node->node->...->node->[prev]->[tail]
#    2 here means: don't compress head or head->next or tail->prev or tail,
#    but compress all nodes between them.
# 3: [head]->[next]->[next]->node->node->...->node->[prev]->[prev]->[tail]
# etc.

# Sets have a special encoding in just one case: when a set is composed
# of just strings that happen to be integers in radix 10 in the range
# of 64 bit signed integers.
# The following configuration setting sets the limit in the size of the
# set in order to use this special memory saving encoding.
set-max-intset-entries 512

# Similarly to hashes and lists, sorted sets are also specially encoded in
# order to save a lot of space. This encoding is only used when the length and
# elements of a sorted set are below the following limits:
zset-max-ziplist-entries 128
zset-max-ziplist-value 64

# HyperLogLog sparse representation bytes limit. The limit includes the
# 16 bytes header. When an HyperLogLog using the sparse representation crosses
# this limit, it is converted into the dense representation.
#
# A value greater than 16000 is totally useless, since at that point the
# dense representation is more memory efficient.
#
# The suggested value is ~ 3000 in order to have the benefits of
# the space efficient encoding without slowing down too much PFADD,
# which is O(N) with the sparse encoding. The value can be raised to
# ~ 10000 when CPU is not a concern, but space is, and the data set is
# composed of many HyperLogLogs with cardinality in the 0 - 15000 range.
hll-sparse-max-bytes 3000

# Streams macro node max size / items. The stream data structure is a radix
# tree of big nodes that encode multiple items inside. Using this configuration
# it is possible to configure how big a single node can be in bytes, and the
# maximum number of items it may contain before switching to a new node when
# appending new stream entries. If any of the following settings are set to
# zero, the limit is ignored, so for instance it is possible to set just a
# max entries limit by setting max-bytes to 0 and max-entries to the desired

# Active rehashing uses 1 millisecond every 100 milliseconds of CPU time in
# order to help rehashing the main Redis hash table (the one mapping top-level
# keys to values). The hash table implementation Redis uses (see dict.c)
# performs a lazy rehashing: the more operation you run into a hash table
# that is rehashing, the more rehashing "steps" are performed, so if the
# server is idle the rehashing is never complete and some more memory is used
# by the hash table.
#
# The default is to use this millisecond 10 times every second in order to
# actively rehash the main dictionaries, freeing memory when possible.
#
# If unsure:
# use "activerehashing no" if you have hard latency requirements and it is
# not a good thing in your environment that Redis can reply from time to time
# to queries with 2 milliseconds delay.
#
# use "activerehashing yes" if you don't have such hard requirements but
# want to free memory asap when possible.

# The client output buffer limits can be used to force disconnection of clients
# that are not reading data from the server fast enough for some reason (a
# common reason is that a Pub/Sub client can't consume messages as fast as the
# publisher can produce them).
#
# The limit can be set differently for the three different classes of clients:
#
# normal -> normal clients including MONITOR clients
# replica  -> replica clients
# pubsub -> clients subscribed to at least one pubsub channel or pattern
#
# The syntax of every client-output-buffer-limit directive is the following:
#
# client-output-buffer-limit <class> <hard limit> <soft limit> <soft seconds>
#
# A client is immediately disconnected once the hard limit is reached, or if
# the soft limit is reached and remains reached for the specified number of
# seconds (continuously).
# So for instance if the hard limit is 32 megabytes and the soft limit is
# 16 megabytes / 10 seconds, the client will get disconnected immediately
# if the size of the output buffers reach 32 megabytes, but will also get
# disconnected if the client reaches 16 megabytes and continuously overcomes
# the limit for 10 seconds.
#
# By default normal clients are not limited because they don't receive data
# without asking (in a push way), but just after a request, so only
# asynchronous clients may create a scenario where data is requested faster
# than it can read.
#
# Instead there is a default limit for pubsub and replica clients, since
# subscribers and replicas receive data in a push fashion.
#
# Both the hard or the soft limit can be disabled by setting them to zero.

# Client query buffers accumulate new commands. They are limited to a fixed
# amount by default in order to avoid that a protocol desynchronization (for
# instance due to a bug in the client) will lead to unbound memory usage in
# the query buffer. However you can configure it here if you have very special
# needs, such us huge multi/exec requests or alike.
#
# client-query-buffer-limit 1gb

# In the Redis protocol, bulk requests, that are, elements representing single
# strings, are normally limited to 512 mb. However you can change this limit
# here, but must be 1mb or greater
#
# proto-max-bulk-len 512mb

# Redis calls an internal function to perform many background tasks, like
# closing connections of clients in timeout, purging expired keys that are
# never requested, and so forth.
#
# Not all tasks are performed with the same frequency, but Redis checks for
# tasks to perform according to the specified "hz" value.
#
# By default "hz" is set to 10. Raising the value will use more CPU when
# Redis is idle, but at the same time will make Redis more responsive when
# there are many keys expiring at the same time, and timeouts may be
# handled with more precision.
#
# The range is between 1 and 500, however a value over 100 is usually not
# a good idea. Most users should use the default of 10 and raise this up to
# 100 only in environments where very low latency is required.
hz 10

# Normally it is useful to have an HZ value which is proportional to the
# number of clients connected. This is useful in order, for instance, to
# avoid too many clients are processed for each background task invocation
# in order to avoid latency spikes.
#
# Since the default HZ value by default is conservatively set to 10, Redis
# offers, and enables by default, the ability to use an adaptive HZ value
# which will temporarily raise when there are many connected clients.
#
# When dynamic HZ is enabled, the actual configured HZ will be used
# as a baseline, but multiples of the configured HZ value will be actually
# used as needed once more clients are connected. In this way an idle
# instance will use very little CPU time while a busy instance will be
# more responsive.
dynamic-hz yes

# When a child rewrites the AOF file, if the following option is enabled
# the file will be fsync-ed every 32 MB of data generated. This is useful
# in order to commit the file to the disk more incrementally and avoid
# big latency spikes.
aof-rewrite-incremental-fsync yes

# When redis saves RDB file, if the following option is enabled
# the file will be fsync-ed every 32 MB of data generated. This is useful
# in order to commit the file to the disk more incrementally and avoid

rdb-save-incremental-fsync yes

# Redis LFU eviction (see maxmemory setting) can be tuned. However it is a good
# idea to start with the default settings and only change them after investigating
# how to improve the performances and how the keys LFU change over time, which
# is possible to inspect via the OBJECT FREQ command.
#
# There are two tunable parameters in the Redis LFU implementation: the
# counter logarithm factor and the counter decay time. It is important to
# understand what the two parameters mean before changing them.
#
# The LFU counter is just 8 bits per key, it's maximum value is 255, so Redis
# uses a probabilistic increment with logarithmic behavior. Given the value
# of the old counter, when a key is accessed, the counter is incremented in
# this way:
#
# 1. A random number R between 0 and 1 is extracted.
# 2. A probability P is calculated as 1/(old_value*lfu_log_factor+1).
# 3. The counter is incremented only if R < P.
#
# The default lfu-log-factor is 10. This is a table of how the frequency
# counter changes with a different number of accesses with different
# logarithmic factors:
#
# +--------+------------+------------+------------+------------+------------+
# | factor | 100 hits   | 1000 hits  | 100K hits  | 1M hits    | 10M hits   |
# +--------+------------+------------+------------+------------+------------+
# | 0      | 104        | 255        | 255        | 255        | 255        |
# +--------+------------+------------+------------+------------+------------+
# | 1      | 18         | 49         | 255        | 255        | 255        |
# +--------+------------+------------+------------+------------+------------+
# | 10     | 10         | 18         | 142        | 255        | 255        |
# +--------+------------+------------+------------+------------+------------+
# | 100    | 8          | 11         | 49         | 143        | 255        |
# +--------+------------+------------+------------+------------+------------+
#
# NOTE: The above table was obtained by running the following commands:
#
#   redis-benchmark -n 1000000 incr foo
#   redis-cli object freq foo
#
# NOTE 2: The counter initial value is 5 in order to give new objects a chance
# to accumulate hits.
#
# The counter decay time is the time, in minutes, that must elapse in order
# for the key counter to be divided by two (or decremented if it has a value
# less <= 10).
#
# The default value for the lfu-decay-time is 1. A special value of 0 means to
# decay the counter every time it happens to be scanned.
#
# lfu-log-factor 10
# lfu-decay-time 1

########################### ACTIVE DEFRAGMENTATION #######################
#
# What is active defragmentation?
# -------------------------------
#
# Active (online) defragmentation allows a Redis server to compact the
# spaces left between small allocations and deallocations of data in memory,
# thus allowing to reclaim back memory.
#
# Fragmentation is a natural process that happens with every allocator (but
# less so with Jemalloc, fortunately) and certain workloads. Normally a server
# restart is needed in order to lower the fragmentation, or at least to flush
# away all the data and create it again. However thanks to this feature
# implemented by Oran Agra for Redis 4.0 this process can happen at runtime
# in a "hot" way, while the server is running.
#
# Basically when the fragmentation is over a certain level (see the
# configuration options below) Redis will start to create new copies of the
# values in contiguous memory regions by exploiting certain specific Jemalloc
# features (in order to understand if an allocation is causing fragmentation
# and to allocate it in a better place), and at the same time, will release the
# old copies of the data. This process, repeated incrementally for all the keys
# will cause the fragmentation to drop back to normal values.
#
# Important things to understand:
#
# 1. This feature is disabled by default, and only works if you compiled Redis
#    to use the copy of Jemalloc we ship with the source code of Redis.
#    This is the default with Linux builds.
#
# 2. You never need to enable this feature if you don't have fragmentation
#    issues.
#
# 3. Once you experience fragmentation, you can enable this feature when
#    needed with the command "CONFIG SET activedefrag yes".
#
# The configuration parameters are able to fine tune the behavior of the
# defragmentation process. If you are not sure about what they mean it is
# a good idea to leave the defaults untouched.

# Enabled active defragmentation
# activedefrag no

# Minimum amount of fragmentation waste to start active defrag
# active-defrag-ignore-bytes 100mb

# Minimum percentage of fragmentation to start active defrag
# active-defrag-threshold-lower 10

# Maximum percentage of fragmentation at which we use maximum effort
# active-defrag-threshold-upper 100

# Minimal effort for defrag in CPU percentage, to be used when the lower
# threshold is reached
# active-defrag-cycle-min 1

# Maximal effort for defrag in CPU percentage, to be used when the upper
# threshold is reached
# active-defrag-cycle-max 25

# Maximum number of set/hash/zset/list fields that will be processed from
# the main dictionary scan
# active-defrag-max-scan-fields 1000

# Jemalloc background thread for purging will be enabled by default
jemalloc-bg-thread yes

# It is possible to pin different threads and processes of Redis to specific
# CPUs in your system, in order to maximize the performances of the server.
# This is useful both in order to pin different Redis threads in different
# CPUs, but also in order to make sure that multiple Redis instances running
# in the same host will be pinned to different CPUs.
#
# Normally you can do this using the "taskset" command, however it is also
# possible to this via Redis configuration directly, both in Linux and FreeBSD.
#
# You can pin the server/IO threads, bio threads, aof rewrite child process, and
# the bgsave child process. The syntax to specify the cpu list is the same as
# the taskset command:
#
# Set redis server/io threads to cpu affinity 0,2,4,6:
# server_cpulist 0-7:2
#
# Set bio threads to cpu affinity 1,3:
# bio_cpulist 1,3
#
# Set aof rewrite child process to cpu affinity 8,9,10,11:
# aof_rewrite_cpulist 8-11
#
# Set bgsave child process to cpu affinity 1,10,11
# bgsave_cpulist 1,10-11

# In some cases redis will emit warnings and even refuse to start if it detects
# that the system is in bad state, it is possible to suppress these warnings
# by setting the following config which takes a space delimited list of warnings
# to suppress
#
# ignore-warnings ARM64-COW-BUG

### 安装Minio

安装启动   

我们提供的镜像中已经有minio的环境，我们可以使用docker进行环境部署和启动

```sh
docker run -d --name minio \
  --restart=always \
  --net=host \
  -e "MINIO_ACCESS_KEY=minio" \
  -e "MINIO_SECRET_KEY=minio123" \
  -e "MINIO_BROWSER_REDIRECT_URL=http://192.168.150.102:9090/" \
  -v /usr/local/src/minio/data:/data \
  -v /usr/local/src/minio/config:/root/.minio \
  -p 9000:9000 -p 9090:9090 \
  minio/minio:RELEASE.2022-12-12T19-27-27Z server \
  /data --console-address ":9090" -address ":9000"
```

注意：需要在最后加上 `--console-address ":9090" -address ":9000"` 否则无法进入管理控制台

[docker遇到的错误:Get https://registry-1.docker.io/v2/: dial tcp: lookup ](https://blog.csdn.net/qq_43416157/article/details/116788106)

Kafka对于zookeeper是强依赖，保存kafka相关的节点数据，所以安装Kafka之前必须先安装zookeeper

- Docker安装zookeeper

下载镜像：

```sh
docker pull zookeeper:3.4.12
```

创建容器

```shell
docker run -d --name zookeeper \
-v /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime \
-p 2181:2181 \
zookeeper:3.4.12
```

- Docker安装kafka

下载镜像：

```shell
docker pull wurstmeister/kafka:2.12-2.3.1
```

创建容器

```shell
docker run -d \
--name kafka \
--net=host \
-e KAFKA_ADVERTISED_HOST_NAME=192.168.150.102 \
-e KAFKA_ZOOKEEPER_CONNECT=192.168.150.102:2181 \
-e KAFKA_ADVERTISED_LISTENERS=PLAINTEXT://192.168.150.102:9092 \
-e KAFKA_LISTENERS=PLAINTEXT://0.0.0.0:9092 \
-e KAFKA_HEAP_OPTS="-Xmx256M -Xms256M" \
wurstmeister/kafka:2.12-2.3.1

### 安装Jenkins

[jenkins/jenkins Tags | Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/jenkins/jenkins/tags?page=1&name=2.361.1-)

![image-20240229020645379](assets/image-20240229020645379.png)

创建 Jenkins 用户，Jenkis不能加Root用户，并且Jenkins用户 id要在 1000

```sh
useradd -U -m jenkins
usermod -aG docker jenkins
usermod -aG root jenkins
chmod 777 /var/run/docker.sock
mkdir -p /usr/local/src/jenkins
sudo chown -R 1000:1000 /usr/local/src/jenkins
```

将插件放入 plugins目录中，并修改目录权限



Docker 命令行启动

```sh
docker run -d \
  --name=jenkins \
  --privileged=true \
  --restart=always \
  --network=hmtt \
  -e JAVA_OPTS="-server -Xms1024m -Xmx1024m -XX:PermSize=256m -XX:MaxPermSize=512m" \
  -e PHP_TZ="Asia/Shanghai" \
  -v /usr/local/src/jenkins:/var/jenkins_home \
  -v /usr/bin/docker:/usr/bin/docker \
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  -p 18080:8080 \
  -p 50000:50000 \
  jenkins/jenkins:2.361.1-lts-jdk11
```

打开宿主机 Jenkins 工作目录下的 `hudson.model.UpdateCenter.xml` 文件。

```sh
vim /usr/local/src/jenkins/hudson.model.UpdateCenter.xml
```

原始内容如下：

```xml
<?xml version='1.1' encoding='UTF-8'?>
<sites>
  <site>
    <id>default</id>
    <url>https://updates.jenkins.io/update-center.json</url>
  </site>
</sites>
```

url 修改为国内的清华大学官方镜像地址，最终内容如下：

```xml
<?xml version='1.1' encoding='UTF-8'?>
<sites>
  <site>
    <id>default</id>
    <url>https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/jenkins/updates/dynamic-2.361/update-center.json</url>
  </site>
</sites>
```

修改 default.json 

```sh
find / -name default.json
cd /usr/local/src/jenkins/updates/

# 下载
wget https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/jenkins/updates/dynamic-2.346/update-center.json

# 改名
mv update-center.json default.json
```

重启  Jenkins，登录 Jenkins 进行配置：http://192.168.150.102:18080/

![image-20240229022810480](assets/image-20240229022810480.png)

复制本地密码

```sh

#### 配置 Jenkins

**主机 SSH 配置**

Jenkins 是通过 Docker 启动的，而 Jenkins 需要执行 Shell 脚本则需要远程主机 SSH 配置

```sh
ssh-keygen
ssh-copy-id -i /root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub root@192.168.150.102
cp /root/.ssh/id_rsa /usr/local/src/jenkins/.ssh/
cp /root/.ssh/known_hosts /usr/local/src/jenkins/.ssh/
sudo chown -R 1000:1000 /usr/local/src/jenkins
```

  <!-- profiles
   | This is a list of profiles which can be activated in a variety of ways, and which can modify
   | the build process. Profiles provided in the settings.xml are intended to provide local machine-
   | specific paths and repository locations which allow the build to work in the local environment.
   |
   | For example, if you have an integration testing plugin - like cactus - that needs to know where
   | your Tomcat instance is installed, you can provide a variable here such that the variable is
   | dereferenced during the build process to configure the cactus plugin.
   |
   | As noted above, profiles can be activated in a variety of ways. One way - the activeProfiles
   | section of this document (settings.xml) - will be discussed later. Another way essentially
   | relies on the detection of a property, either matching a particular value for the property,
   | or merely testing its existence. Profiles can also be activated by JDK version prefix, where a
   | value of '1.4' might activate a profile when the build is executed on a JDK version of '1.4.2_07'.
   | Finally, the list of active profiles can be specified directly from the command line.
   |
   | NOTE: For profiles defined in the settings.xml, you are restricted to specifying only artifact
   |       repositories, plugin repositories, and free-form properties to be used as configuration
   |       variables for plugins in the POM.
   |
   |-->
  <profiles>
    <!-- profile
     | Specifies a set of introductions to the build process, to be activated using one or more of the
     | mechanisms described above. For inheritance purposes, and to activate profiles via <activatedProfiles/>
     | or the command line, profiles have to have an ID that is unique.
     |
     | An encouraged best practice for profile identification is to use a consistent naming convention
     | for profiles, such as 'env-dev', 'env-test', 'env-production', 'user-jdcasey', 'user-brett', etc.
     | This will make it more intuitive to understand what the set of introduced profiles is attempting
     | to accomplish, particularly when you only have a list of profile id's for debug.
     |
     | This profile example uses the JDK version to trigger activation, and provides a JDK-specific repo.
    <profile>
      <id>jdk-1.4</id>

      <activation>
        <jdk>1.4</jdk>
      </activation>

      <repositories>
        <repository>
          <id>jdk14</id>
          <name>Repository for JDK 1.4 builds</name>
          <url>http://www.myhost.com/maven/jdk14</url>
          <layout>default</layout>
          <snapshotPolicy>always</snapshotPolicy>
        </repository>
      </repositories>
    </profile>
    -->

    <!--
     | Here is another profile, activated by the property 'target-env' with a value of 'dev', which
     | provides a specific path to the Tomcat instance. To use this, your plugin configuration might
     | hypothetically look like:
     |
     | ...
     | <plugin>
     |   <groupId>org.myco.myplugins</groupId>
     |   <artifactId>myplugin</artifactId>
     |
     |   <configuration>
     |     <tomcatLocation>${tomcatPath}</tomcatLocation>
     |   </configuration>
     | </plugin>
     | ...
     |
     | NOTE: If you just wanted to inject this configuration whenever someone set 'target-env' to
     |       anything, you could just leave off the <value/> inside the activation-property.
     |
    <profile>
      <id>env-dev</id>

      <activation>
        <property>
          <name>target-env</name>

在 gogs 中设置 Web 钩子，密钥文本就是对应 Jenkins 中设置钩子，这样每当有代码提交 gogs 都会自动更新。

环境配置

## 前端集成

### 前端项目部署思路

nginx配置

![image-20210416095950485](assets/image-20210416095950485.png)

通过nginx来进行配置，功能如下

- 通过nginx的反向代理功能访问后台的网关资源
- 通过nginx的静态服务器功能访问前端静态页面



### 配置 Nginx

①：解压资料文件夹中的压缩包nginx-1.18.0.zip

②：解压资料文件夹中的前端项目app-web.zip

③：配置nginx.conf文件

在nginx安装的conf目录下新建一个文件夹`leadnews.conf`,在当前文件夹中新建`heima-leadnews-app.conf`文件

heima-leadnews-app.conf配置如下：



#### app服务

```nginx
server {
    listen       80;
    server_name  app.hmtt.com;

    location / {
         root /usr/share/nginx/html/app-web;
         index  index.html index.htm;
    }

    location ~/app/(.*) {
        proxy_pass http://192.168.150.102:51601/$1; # 服务器测试
    	  # proxy_pass http://192.168.150.102:51601/$1; # 本地测试
        proxy_set_header HOST $host;  # 不改变源请求头的值
        proxy_pass_request_body on;  # 开启获取请求体
        proxy_pass_request_headers on;  # 开启获取请求头
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;   # 记录真实发出请求的客户端IP
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;  #记录代理信息
     }
}
```



```nginx
upstream  heima-app-gateway{
    server 192.168.150.102:51601; 	 # 服务器测试
    # server 192.168.150.102:51601;  # 本地测试
}

server {
    listen       80;
    server_name  www.hmtt.com;

    location / {
         root /usr/share/nginx/html/app-web;
         index  index.html index.htm;
    }

    location ~/app/(.*) {
        proxy_pass http://heima-app-gateway/$1;
        proxy_set_header HOST $host;  # 不改变源请求头的值
        proxy_pass_request_body on;  # 开启获取请求体
        proxy_pass_request_headers on;  #开启获取请求头
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;   # 记录真实发出请求的客户端IP
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;  #记录代理信息
     }
}
```

nginx.conf   把里面注释的内容和静态资源配置相关删除，引入heima-leadnews-app.conf文件加载

```nginx
#user  nobody;
worker_processes  1;

events {
    worker_connections  1024;
}
http {
    include       			mime.types;
    default_type  			application/octet-stream;
    sendfile        		on;
    keepalive_timeout  	65;
	  # 引入自定义配置文件
 	  include /etc/nginx/leadnews/*.conf;
}
```

④ ：启动nginx

​    在nginx安装包中使用命令提示符打开，输入命令nginx启动项目

​    可查看进程，检查nginx是否启动

​	重新加载配置文件：`nginx -s reload`

⑤：打开前端项目进行测试  -- >  http://localhost:8801

​     用谷歌浏览器打开，调试移动端模式进行访问





#### media前台搭建

通过nginx的虚拟主机功能，使用同一个nginx访问多个项目

![image-20210426110913007](assets\image-20210426110913007.png)



搭建步骤：

①：资料中找到wemedia-web.zip解压

②：在nginx中leadnews.conf目录中新增heima-leadnews-wemedia.conf文件

- 网关地址修改（localhost:51602）

- 前端项目目录修改（wemedia-web解压的目录）

- 访问端口修改(8802)

```nginx
upstream  heima-wemedia-gateway{
   # server 192.168.150.102:51601; #服务器测试
  	server 192.168.150.1:51602;		#本地测试
}

server {
   	listen       80;
    server_name  media.hmtt.com;
   	location / {
      	root /usr/share/nginx/html/wemedia-web/;
   			index index.html;
		}

   	location ~/wemedia/MEDIA/(.*) {
      	proxy_pass http://heima-wemedia-gateway/$1;
      	proxy_set_header HOST $host;  # 不改变源请求头的值
      	proxy_pass_request_body on;  #开启获取请求体
      	proxy_pass_request_headers on;  #开启获取请求头
      	proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;   # 记录真实发出请求的客户端IP
      	proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;  #记录代理信息
   }
}
```

③：启动nginx，启动自媒体微服务和对应网关

④：联调测试登录功能
